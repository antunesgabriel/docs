## General

To customize your widget you must access your project's [widget page](https://app.logaflow.com/workspace/settings/widget)

<img src="/images/customization.png" className="h-48 object-cover rounded" />

### Log Collection

In this section you can configure which levels of console logs logaflow can capture, by default we capture them all.

### Replay

In this section you can enable and disable the function of recording the [user session](/feedback/details.mdx) for replay. By default it is active.

### Networks

In this section you can configure the requests that can be captured by logaflow. By default all requests made are captured, you can limit this by adding the specific sources you want to monitor.

<Note>Logaflow does not capture sensitive information from requests.</Note>

## Widget customization

### Customize widget trigger
You can customize the trigger that opens the feedback popup. To use a customizable trigger you must first disable logaflow's default trigger:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Pass useCustomTrigger prop">
    ```tsx
    import React from 'react'
    import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client'

    import { LogaflowWidget } from '@logaflow/react'
    import '@/styles/globals.css'

    import AppRoot from './app.root.tsx'

    ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')!).render(
    <React.StrictMode>
        <>
        {/* Add useCustomTrigger prop */}
        <LogaflowWidget projectKey={YOUR_PROJECT_TOKEN} useCustomTrigger />
        <AppRoot />
        </>
    </React.StrictMode>
    )
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Use widget hook in your custom trigger">
    ```tsx
    import { useWidget } from '@logaflow/react'

    export const CustomTriggerComponent = () => {
        const { open, isOpen } = useWidget()
        return <button onClick={open}>{isOpen ? 'Opened' : 'Can I help you?'}</button>
    }
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Using your custom trigger">
    ```tsx
    import { Outlet } from 'react-router-dom'

    import { CustomTriggerComponent } from '@/components/common/custom-trigger.component'

    function PrivateLayout() {
        return (
            <>
                <CustomTriggerComponent />
                <Outlet />
            </>
        )
    }

    export default PrivateLayout
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>
