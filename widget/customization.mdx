### Log Collection

In this section you can configure which levels of console logs logaflow can capture, by default we capture them all.

### Replay

In this section you can enable and disable the function of recording the [user session](/feedback/details.mdx) for replay. By default it is active.

### Networks

In this section you can configure the requests that can be captured by logaflow. By default all requests made are captured, you can limit this by adding the specific sources you want to monitor.

<Note>Logaflow does not capture sensitive information from requests.</Note>
